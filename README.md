# TvTalk

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
At LeWagon we discovered that if you wanted to have discussions about movies, there were no places to do so. We set out to build, in a team of three, a website that could solve this problem.
In TvTalk you can start a discussion based on a movie, join other discussions, or reply to individual posts. Also you can keep in touch with your friends and share private opinions and suggestions between yourselves, or share them with others.
